        <title>Automotive Startup Canoo Debuts a Snub-Nosed Electric Pickup</title>
        <link>
            https://tech.slashdot.org/story/21/03/11/2250247/automotive-startup-canoo-debuts-a-snub-nosed-electric-pickup?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed
        </link>
        <description>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Car and Driver: Canoo, an electric automotive startup
            based in California, has expanded its lineup of forthcoming electric vehicles by revealing this snub-nosed
            pickup. The pickup, which sports a design similar to Canoo's passenger van, will offer more than 200 miles
            of range and as much as 600 horsepower and 550 pound-feet of torque with the dual-motor configuration; a
            rear motor configuration will also be offered. That power and range, and a full six-to-eight-foot pickup
            bed, all have to fit into a vehicle with a 112.2-inch wheelbase -- an inch shorter than the Tesla Model 3 --
            and an overall length, at 184 inches, that makes it more than two feet shorter than the Ford Ranger pickup.

            The pickup rides on Canoo's multi-purpose platform architecture and will be the third Canoo vehicle to do
            so. [...] The new pickup emphasizes modularity and looks to maximize its utility. It has tables folding down
            around the vehicle, various hidden storage areas, and numerous charging points on the exterior of the truck.
            In a video exploring the ins and outs, Tony Aquila, executive chairman of Canoo, said that the goal was to
            make something that was very functional and could also be personalized. On either side of the six-foot bed,
            tables fold down to function as a workspace, and there is also a table that folds down from the front of the
            truck. That table exposes a small storage area as well as various points to charge or power electronics. The
            pickup bed can also be extended, as well as enclosed, to eight feet long to fit bigger items. Steps with
            storage within them can be pulled out of the sides of the truck to make it easier to access anything on the
            roof rack. And to answer the question any truck owner would ask, yes, there's a taillamp setup in the bed
            extension, so it's okay to drive the truck with the bed extended to fit longer cargo.

            The interior of the pickup, shown in the video, shows it fits two people, but Aquila said it could be
            adapted for a three-person setup. Information such as speed and battery levels appear to be on a broad
            screen just below the windshield. Canoo's pickup will be available for pre-order beginning in the second
            quarter of this year, but production isn't slated to begin until 2023.&lt;p&gt;&lt;div

        <title>Adobe Officially Releases Photoshop For Apple M1, Says It's 50% Faster</title>

        <description>Adobe today officially unveiled Photoshop for Apple's M1 chip, claiming it provides a 50%
            performance boost compared to analogous Intel Macs. The Next Web reports: While Adobe has had a beta version
            of Photoshop for M1 available since November, this is the first time it's been available widely. Previously
            Apple users could run the Intel version through Apple's Rosetta technology, which didn't fully take
            advantage of the new chip's power.

            [According to Adobe:] "Our internal tests show a wide range of features running an average of 1.5X the speed
            of similarly configured previous generation systems. Our tests covered a broad scope of activities,
            including opening and saving files, running filters, and compute-heavy operations like Content-Aware Fill
            and Select Subject, which all feel noticeably faster. Our early benchmarking also shows that some operations
            are substantially faster with the new chip." Be warned that there are a couple of recent features missing on
            the M1 version of the app, most notably inviting others to edit cloud documents and preset syncing.&lt;p&gt;&lt;div

        <description>samleecole writes from a report via Motherboard: MacOS is generally intended as a desktop operating
            system, and while it's a very functional operating system, Apple expects it to run on a single piece of
            hardware. As any developer or infrastructure architect can tell you, virtualization is an impressive
            technique that allows programmers and infrastructure pros to expand reach and scale things up far beyond a
            single user. A Github project that has gotten a bit of attention in recent months aims to make MacOS
            scalable in ways that it has basically never been. Its secret weapon is a serial code generator: Docker-OSX
            has the ability to generate serial codes for unique pieces of MacOS hardware, and its main developer, an
            open-source developer and security researcher who goes by the pseudonym Sick Codes, recently released a
            standalone serial code generator that can replicate codes for nonexistent devices by the thousands. Just
            type in a command, and it will set up a CSV file full of serial codes. "You can generate hundreds and
            thousands of serial numbers, just like that," Sick Codes, who used a pseudonym due to the nature of his
            work, said. "And it just generates a massive list." A valid serial code allows you to use Apple-based tools
            such as iMessage, iCloud, and the App Store inside of MacOS. It's the confirmation that you're using
            something seen as valid in the eyes of Apple. "I actually went through, and I've got like 15 iMac Pros in my
            Apple account now, and it says that they're all valid for iMessage," the creator said.&lt;p&gt;&lt;div

        <description>MojoKid writes: Some may think it strange to design and build an entire PC and custom enclosure,
            dedicated to running a 20-year-old screensaver, but retro computing fans and well-seasoned enthusiasts may
            remember the SereneScreen Marine Aquarium. This classic screensaver from the late 90s was created by the
            legendary artist of Defender of the Crown and more, Jim Sachs. SereneScreen's combination of beautiful fish
            and technology is still mesmerizing, so why not build a miniature, 3D-printed aquarium and power it with a
            single board computer like the Rock Pi X and a 1920X480 resolution IPS LCD display? That's just what product
            developer Colton Westrate did.

            Searching for an x86 PC in a Raspberry Pi-sized form factor, Westrate chose the Rock Pi X that purportedly
            packs the perfunctory punch to push the Windows OS and aquarium screen saver's pulsating pixels. The Rock Pi
            X is based on a circa 2016 Intel x5-Z8350 processor, which is a 2-watt, quad-core Cherry Trail Atom chip.
            From there, with a little Fusion 360 parametric modeling, a clear acrylic napkin holder, and some serious
            skills, Westrate created this adorable pint-sized digital fish tank. There's a full parts list and how-to
            guide on HotHardware, along with links to the CAD files up on Thingiverse, so you can build yourself one
            too, if you're feeling inspired.&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;"&gt;

        <title>Cryptominers Have Already Cracked Nvidia's RTX 3060 Hash Rate Limiter</title>

        <description>An anonymous reader quotes a report from TechRadar: When the GeForce RTX 3060 was launched on
            February 25, Nvidia announced that the mining efficiency of the graphics card was deliberately being reduced
            by around 50% in a bid to get more of the GPUs directly to gamers. However, this limitation appears to have
            been quickly bypassed by Chinese cryptocurrency miners using customized mods. There was already concern
            brewing about how well the limiter would stand against savvy miners, but Nvidia has been vocally confident
            in the hash rate limit. A statement was given to PC Gamer regarding how difficult it would be to get around
            the protections placed on the GPUs, claiming "End users cannot remove the hash limiter from the driver.
            There is a secure handshake between the driver, the RTX 3060 silicon, and the BIOS (firmware) that prevents
            removal of the hash rate limiter."

            The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 can deliver around 40-45 MH/s for standard performance but this dropped down to
            20-25 MH/s if the GPU detected mining-related activity, providing the limiter is in place. A picture spotted
            by I_Leak_VN reveals a Chinese mod developed to help miners unlock the full hash potential of the GeForce
            RTX 3060 graphics card, with the image showing the Geforce RTX 3060 delivering 45 MH/s in Ethereum. The
            hash-rate limiter mod has also been separately confirmed to work by a Vietnamese Facebook group, apparently
            even capable of outputting 50 MH/s. So far, according to Wccftech, it appears that the cryptomining
            algorithm in question is for Octopus, which is different than cryptocurrency than Ethereum, which the
            hashrate limiter was designed to thwart. That means its possible that an updated driver could introduce a
            limiter for that cryptocurrency as well, but as we explored earlier this month, Nvidia's efforts to thwart
            cryptomining is likely fraught with legal issues that might prevent such an update.&lt;p&gt;&lt;div

        <description>YouTube has taken down more than 30,000 videos that made misleading or false claims about COVID-19
            vaccines over the last six months. Axios reports: YouTube first started including vaccination misinformation
            in its COVID-19 medical misinformation policy in October 2020. Since February 2020, YouTube has taken down
            more than 800,000 videos containing coronavirus misinformation. The videos are first flagged by either the
            company's AI systems or human reviewers, then receive another level of review.

            Videos that violate the vaccine policy, according to YouTube's rules, are those that contradict expert
            consensus on the vaccines from health authorities or the World Health Organization. Accounts that violate
            YouTube's rules are subject to a "strike" system, which can result in accounts being permanently banned.
            "Platforms are eager to share data about the volume of misinformation they catch, and that transparency is
            valuable," adds Axios. "But the most valuable data would tell us the extent of misinformation that isn't
            caught."&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="share_submission" style="position:relative;"&gt;

        <title>Netflix Tests Cracking Down On Password Sharing</title>

            https://yro.slashdot.org/story/21/03/11/2118251/netflix-tests-cracking-down-on-password-sharing?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed

        <description>Netflix is testing a new feature that could signal the start of an effort to crack down on password
            sharing. Hollywood Reporter reports: Spotted by GammaWire, some viewers attempting to use somebody else's
            account are now being stopped by a screen that says, "If you don't live with the owner of this account, you
            need your own account to keep watching." Netflix confirmed the new feature, which is getting a limited
            rollout at this time. "This test is designed to help ensure that people using Netflix accounts are
            authorized to do so," a Netflix spokesperson said.

            In order to continue watching, the viewer is given the option of either verifying their identity (with a
            texted or emailed code to the account's owner), or opting to "verify later," which gives the viewer an
            unspecified additional amount of time to continue watching and later confirm they are a valid account user.
            A source familiar with the tests said the extent of the rollout varies from country to country, but noted
            that one reason for the feature is a desire to help protect subscribers from security concerns that can
            arise from unauthorized use of their account.&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="share_submission"

        <description>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: Yesterday, Roblox made good on its plans to
            go public, with employees and previous investors selling hundreds of millions of shares in a direct listing
            on the New York Stock Exchange. In a private funding round in January, those shares were worth $45. When the
            market closed Wednesday, they were selling at $69.50, a price that valued Roblox Corp. as a whole at $45.3
            billion (as of this writing, Roblox Corp.'s stock price peaked at $77.30 and currently sits at $72.72 in
            Thursday morning trading).

            How did this company, whose single title has become a game platform unto itself, become worth more than
            major game publishers like Electronic Arts and Take-Two? To help answer that question, we put together this
            deep dive into the numbers that are powering the Roblox revolution. They paint a picture of a company with
            an extremely young and incredibly engaged user base that has ballooned during the 2020 pandemic lockdowns.
            But Roblox is also a company that is struggling to convert its huge and growing annual revenues into
            profitability. Here are the valuations of Roblox and how it compares to the other gaming companies:

            Roblox
            - Jan. 2017: $500 million
            - July 2018: $2.3 billion
            - Feb. 2020: $3.9 billion
            - Jan. 2021: $29.5 billion
            - March 10, 2021: $45.3 billion

            Other gaming companies (current valuations)
            - Ubisoft: $9.58 billion
            - Take-Two: $19.43 billion
            - Electronic Arts: $38.09 billion
            - Roblox: $45.3 billion
            - Activision: $72.23 billion
            - Tencent: $843.86 billion

        <description>Google CEO Sundar Pichai has announced a new certificate program and other courses that will
            provide a gateway to positions at companies like Anthem, Bayer, Deloitte, Verizon and SAP. From a report: In
            a blog post, Pichai explained that on March 11, Coursera users will have access to a new Associate Android
            Developer Certification course in addition to the three new certificates in user experience (UX) design,
            project management and data analytics that have been available since September. "With more businesses
            embracing digital ways of working, it's estimated that 50% of all employees will need reskilling by 2025. As
            U.S. job growth returns with more people getting vaccinated, we are committed to ensuring that all Americans
            have the skills they need to benefit from greater economic opportunity," Pichai wrote.

            "To help, today we're announcing new efforts, including opening up enrollment for our latest career
            certificates, expanding our employer consortium, and introducing new tools to improve the job search."
            Google will be providing 100,000 scholarships for its Career Certificates program and said it has already
            helped bring 170,000 Americans into the tech industry through their certificate platform. Once the program
            is completed, students will gain access to a job board populated by companies like Accenture, Infosys,
            Zennify, SiriusXM+ Pandora, and, of course, Google.&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="share_submission"

        <title>LG is Cramming Ads Everywhere It Can On its TVs</title>

        <description>TV makers are leaving no stone -- or ad spot -- unturned. From a report: This afternoon, I was
            updating the streaming apps on my 2020 LG CX OLED TV, something I do from time to time, but today was
            different. Out of nowhere, I saw (and heard) an ad for Ace Hardware start playing in the lower-left corner.
            It autoplayed with sound without any action on my part. Now I'm fully aware that it's not unusual to see ads
            placed around a TV's home screen or main menu. LG, Samsung, Roku, Vizio, and others are all in on this game.
            We live in an era when smart TVs can automatically recognize what you're watching, and TV makers are
            building nice ad businesses for themselves with all of the data that gets funneled in.

            But this felt pretty egregious even by today's standards. A random, full-on commercial just popping up in
            LG's app store? Is there no escape from this stuff? We're just going to cram ads into every corner of a TV's
            software, huh? Imagine if an autoplay ad started up while you were updating the apps on your smartphone.&lt;p&gt;&lt;div

        <title>Australia Extends Tech Giant Probe To Google and Apple Browser Domination</title>

        <description>With the News Media Bargaining Code out of the way, the Australian government has moved its tech
            giant battle to the browser scene, keeping Google in its crosshairs while putting Apple under the
            microscope. From a report: Led by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), the new battle
            is focused on "choice and competition in internet search and web browsers." The consumer watchdog on
            Thursday put out a call for submissions, with a number of questions posed in a discussion paper , centred on
            internet browser defaults. It claimed Apple's Safari is the most common browser used in Australia for
            smartphones and tablets, accounting for 51% of use. This is followed by Chrome with 39%, Samsung Internet
            with 7%, and with less than 1%, Mozilla Firefox. This shifts on desktop, with Chrome being the most used
            browser with 62% market share, followed by Safari with 18%, Edge 9%, and Mozilla 6%.

            The ACCC said it's concerned with the impact of pre-installation and default settings on consumer choice and
            competition, particularly in relation to online search and browsers. It's also seeking views on supplier
            behaviour and trends in search services, browsers, and operating systems, and device ecosystems that may
            impact the supply of search and browsers to Australian consumers. It wants views also on the extent to which
            existing consumer harm can arise from the design of defaults and other arrangements.&lt;p&gt;&lt;div

        <description>An anonymous reader shares a report: If you've ever been frustrated by a road simply not existing
            on Google Maps, the company's now making it easier than ever to add it. Google will be updating its map
            editing experience to allow users to add missing roads and realign, rename or delete incorrect ones. It
            calls the experience "drawing," but it's closer to using the line tool in Microsoft Paint. The updated tool
            should be "rolling out over the coming months in more than 80 countries," according to a blog post.
            Currently, if you try to add a missing road, you can only drop a pin where the road should be and type in
            the road's name to submit that information to Google. The new tool should make it easier to not only add
            missing roads, but to make corrections such as fixing a road's name or its direction (for example, if the
            road is one-way but Google Maps says it isn't).&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="share_submission"

        <description>Google has denied that recent problems with its services in Russia were the result of a fire at
            cloud provider OVH data centres in Strasbourg. From a report: The Russian authorities had directly blamed
            the blaze for disruptions to Google and YouTube. Google believes an unrelated networking issue was
            responsible for the problems, which lasted for about two hours. It suggests it is a coincidence the two
            events were in the same timeframe. In a statement Google said: "At 02:00 Pacific Time on 10 March we became
            aware of an upstream network issue that partially impacted internet service for users in Russia. We believe
            the cause of this incident was a misconfiguration of the routers at a local third-party internet service
            provider. Following extensive investigation we have no evidence to indicate that the fire in OVHCloud's data
            centre, or Google's own infrastructure, was the root cause of this incident." Russia's media watchdog the
            Federal Service for Supervision in Telecom, IT and Mass Communications - also known as Roskomnadzor- told
            news agency TASS that access to Google, YouTube and a number of other services were "caused by an accident
            in a major European data centre in Strasbourg."&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class="share_submission"
